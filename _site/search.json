Developers can pull in values from the JSON into interface elements, styling them as popovers for user interface text, for example.

However, you will be prompted for your password with each file transfer unless you configure passwordless SSH. The basic process for setting up password less SSH is to create a key on your own machine that you also transfer to the remote machine. When you use the SCP command, the remote machine checks that you have the authorized key and allows access without a password prompt."
