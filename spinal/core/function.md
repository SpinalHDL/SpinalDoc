## Introduction

The ways you can use Scala functions to generate hardware are radically different than VHDL/Verilog for many reasons:

- You can instantiate register, combinatorial logic and component inside them.
- You don't have to play with `process`/`@always` that limit the scope of assignment of signals
- Everything work by reference, which allow many manipulation.<br> For example you can give to a function an bus as argument, then the function can internaly read/write it.<br>You can also return a Component, a Bus, are anything else from scala the scala world.


## RGB to gray

For example if you want to convert a Red/Green/Blue color into a gray one by using coefficient, you can use functions to apply them :

```scala
// Input RGB color
val r, g, b = UInt(8 bits)

// Define a function to multiply a UInt by a scala Float value.
def coef(value: UInt, by: Float): UInt = (value * U((255*by).toInt, 8 bits) >> 8)

// Calculate the gray level
val gray = coef(r, 0.3f) + coef(g, 0.4f) + coef(b, 0.3f)
```


## Valid Ready Payload bus

For instance if you define a simple Valid Ready Payload bus, you can then define usefull function inside it.

```scala
class MyBus(payloadWidth: Int) extends Bundle with IMasterSlave {
  val valid   = Bool
  val ready   = Bool
  val payload = Bits(payloadWidth bits)

  // define the direction of the data in a master mode 
  override des asMaster(): Unit = {
    out(valid, payload)
    in(ready)
  }

  // Connect that to this
  def <<(that: MyBus): Unit = {
    this.valid   := that.valid
    that.ready   := this.ready
    this.payload := that.payload
  }

  // Connect this to the FIFO input, return the fifo output
  def queue(size: Int): MyBus = {
    val fifo = new MyBusFifo(payloadWidth, size)
    fifo.io.push << this
    return fifo.io.pop
  }
}

class MyBusFifo(payloadWidth: Int, deepth: Int) extends Component {

  val io = new Bundle {
    val push = slave(MyBus(payloadWidth))
    val pop  = master(MyBus(payloadWidth))
  }

  val mem = Mem(Bits(payloadWidth bits), deepth)

  // ...

}
```
