## Entity and architecture
In SpinalHDL, a VHDL entity and architecture are both defined inside a `Component`.

Here is an example of a component which has 3 inputs (a,b,c) and an output (result). This component also has an `offset` construction parameter (like a VHDL generic)

```scala
case class MyComponent(offset: Int) extends Component {
  val io = new Bundle{
    val a,b,c  = in UInt(8 bits)
    val result = out UInt(8 bits)
  }
  io.result := a + b + c + offset
}
```

Then to instantiate that component, you don't need to bind it:

```scala
case class TopLevel extends Component{
  ...
  val mySubComponent = MyComponent(offset = 5)

  ...

  mySubComponent.io.a := 1
  mySubComponent.io.b := 2
  mySubComponent.io.c := 3
  ??? := mySubComponent.io.result

  ...
}
```

## Data types
SpinalHDL data types are similar to the VHDL ones:

| VHDL              | SpinalHDL |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| std_logic         | Bool      |
| std_logic_vector  | Bits      |
| unsigned          | UInt      |
| signed            | SInt      |

While for defining an 8 bit `unsigned` in VHDL you have to give the range of bits `unsigned(7 downto 0)`,<br> in SpinalHDL you simply supply the number of bits `UInt(8 bits)`.

| VHDL    | SpinalHDL  |
| ------- | ---------- |
| records | Bundle     |
| array   | Vec        | 
| enum    | SpinalEnum |

Here is an example of the SpinalHDL Bundle definition. `channelWidth` is a construction parameter, like VHDL generics, but for data structures:

```scala
case class RGB(channelWidth: Int) extends Bundle {
  val r,g,b = UInt(channelWidth bits)
}
```

Then for example, to instantiate a Bundle, you need to write `val myColor = RGB(channelWidth=8)`.

## Signal
Here is an example about signal instantiations:

```scala
case class MyComponent(offset: Int) extends Component {
  val io = new Bundle{
    val a,b,c  = UInt(8 bits)
    val result = UInt(8 bits)
  }
  val ab = UInt(8 bits)
  ab := a + b

  val abc = ab + c            //You can define a signal directly with its value
  io.result := abc + offset
}
```

## Assignements
In SpinalHDL, the `:=` assignment operator is equivalent to the VHDL signal assignment (<=):

```scala
val myUInt = UInt(8 bits)
myUInt := 6
```

Conditional assignments are done like in VHDL by using `if/case` statements:

```scala
val clear   = Bool
val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits))

when(clear){
  counter := 0
}.elsewhen(counter === 76){
  counter := 79
}.otherwise{
  counter(7) := ! counter(7)
}

switch(counter){
  is(42){
    counter := 65
  }
  default{
    counter := counter + 1
  }
}
```

## Literals
Literals are a little bit different than in VHDL:

```scala
val myBool = Bool
myBool := False
myBool := True
myBool := Bool(4 > 7)

val myUInt = UInt(8 bits)
myUInt := "0001_1100"
myUInt := "xEE"
myUInt := 42
myUInt := U(54,8 bits)
myUInt := ((3 downto 0) -> myBool,default -> true)
when(myUInt === U(myUInt.range -> true)){
  myUInt(3) := False
}
```

## Registers
In SpinalHDL, registers are explicitly specified while in VHDL it's inferred. Here is an example of SpinalHDL registers:

```scala
val counter = Reg(UInt(8 bits))  init(0)  
counter := counter + 1   //Count up each cycle

//init(0) means that the register should be initialized to zero when a reset occurs
```

## Process blocks
Process blocks are a simulation feature that is unnecessary to design RTL. It's why SpinalHDL doesn't contain any feature analog to process blocks, and you can assign what you want where you want.

```scala
val cond = Bool
val myCombinatorial = Bool
val myRegister = UInt(8 bits)

myCombinatorial := False
when(cond)
  myCombinatorial := True
  myRegister = myRegister + 1
}
```
