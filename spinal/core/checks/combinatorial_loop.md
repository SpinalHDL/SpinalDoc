## Introduction
SpinalHDL will check that there is no combinatorial loop across all the design.

## Example

The following code :

```scala
class TopLevel extends Component {
  val a = UInt(8 bits) //PlayDev.scala line 831
  val b = UInt(8 bits) //PlayDev.scala line 832
  val c = UInt(8 bits)
  val d = UInt(8 bits)

  a := b
  b := c | d
  d := a
  c := 0
}
```

will throw :

```
COMBINATORIAL LOOP :
  Partial chain :
    >>> (toplevel/a :  UInt[8 bits]) at ***(PlayDev.scala:831) >>>
    >>> (toplevel/d :  UInt[8 bits]) at ***(PlayDev.scala:834) >>>
    >>> (toplevel/b :  UInt[8 bits]) at ***(PlayDev.scala:832) >>>
    >>> (toplevel/a :  UInt[8 bits]) at ***(PlayDev.scala:831) >>>

  Full chain :
    (toplevel/a :  UInt[8 bits])
    (toplevel/d :  UInt[8 bits])
    (UInt | UInt)[8 bits]
    (toplevel/b :  UInt[8 bits])
    (toplevel/a :  UInt[8 bits])
```

A fix could be :

```scala
class TopLevel extends Component {
  val a = UInt(8 bits) //PlayDev.scala line 831
  val b = UInt(8 bits) //PlayDev.scala line 832
  val c = UInt(8 bits)
  val d = UInt(8 bits)

  a := b
  b := c | d
  d := 42
  c := 0
}
```

## False-positive

It should be known that currently SpinalHDL is tracking combinatorial loop in a pessimistic way. If it give you a false positive combinatorial loop, you can manualy disable this checks on one signal of the loop.

```scala
class TopLevel extends Component {
  val a = UInt(8 bits)
  a := 0
  a(1) := a(0) //False positive because of this line
}
```

could be fixed by :

```scala
class TopLevel extends Component {
  val a = UInt(8 bits).noCombLoopCheck
  a := 0
  a(1) := a(0)
}
```

It should also be known that this kind of assignements (a(1) := a(0)) could make some tools unhappy (Verilator). It could be preferable to write your logics using an Vec(Bool, 8).
