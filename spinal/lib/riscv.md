## Features
RISC-V CPU

- Pipelined on 5 stages (Fetch Decode Execute0 Execute1 WriteBack)
- Multiple branch prediction modes : (disable, static or dynamic)
- Data path parameterizable between fully bypassed to fully interlocked

Extensions

- One cycle multiplication
- 34 cycle division
- Iterative shifter (N shift -> N cycles)
- Single cycle shifter
- Interruption controller
- Debugging module (with JTAG bridge, openOCD port and GDB)
- Instruction cache with wrapped burst memory interface, one way
- Data cache with instructions to evict/flush the whole cache or a given address, one way

Performance/Area (on cyclone II)

- small core -> 846 LE, 0.6 DMIPS/Mhz
- debug module (without JTAG) -> 240 LE
- JTAG Avalon master -> 238 LE
- big core with MUL/DIV/Full shifter/I$/Interrupt/Debug -> 2200 LE, 1.15 DMIPS/Mhz, at least 100 Mhz (with default synthesis option)

## Base FPGA project
You can find a DE1-SOC project which integrate two instance of the CPU with MUL/DIV/Full shifter/I$/Interrupt/Debug there :

CPU/JTAG/VGA IP are pre-generated.
Quartus Prime : 15.1.

## How to generate the CPU VHDL
There is an example of a top level which generate an Altera QSys component that contain the CPU with Avalon interfaces and some timing buffer :

https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL/blob/master/lib/src/main/scala/spinal/lib/cpu/riscv/impl/CoreQSysAvalon.scala#L97

If you want to generate it, the easiest way is to get the https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalBaseProject and call `QSysAvalonCore.main(null)` from your main function.

## How to debug
You can find the openOCD fork there :

https://github.com/Dolu1990/openocd_riscv

An example target configuration file could be find there :

https://github.com/Dolu1990/openocd_riscv/blob/riscv_spinal/tcl/target/riscv_spinal.cfg

Then you can use the RISCV GDB.

## Todo
- Documentation
- Optimise instruction/data caches FMax by moving line hit condition forward into combinatorial paths.
