VexRiscv is an fpga friendly RISC-V ISA CPU implementation with following features :

- RV32IM instruction set
- Pipelined on 5 stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, WriteBack)
- 1.44 DMIPS/Mhz when all features are enabled
- Optimized for FPGA
- Optional MUL/DIV extension
- Optional instruction and data caches
- Optional MMU
- Optional debug extension allowing eclipse debugging via an GDB >> openOCD >> JTAG connection
- Optional interrupts and exception handling with the Machine and the User mode from the riscv-privileged-v1.9.1 spec.
- Two implementation of shift instructions, Single cycle / shiftNumber cycles
- Each stage could have bypass or interlock hazard logic
- FreeRTOS port https://github.com/Dolu1990/FreeRTOS-RISCV
