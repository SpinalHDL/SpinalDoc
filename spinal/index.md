## Site purpose and structure
This site presents the *SpinalHDL* language and how to use it on concrete examples.

If you are learning the language from scratch, [this presentation](/SpinalDoc/presentation/) is probably a good starting point.

## What is SpinalHDL ?
SpinalHDL is a [open source](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) high-level hardware description language. It can be used as an alternative to VHDL or Verilog and has several advantages over those.

Also SpinalHDL is not a HLS approch, its goal is not to push something abstract into flip-flop and gates, but by using simple elements (flip-flop, gates, if / case statments) create new abstraction level and help the designer to not rewrite always the same thing.

{% include note.html content="SpinalHDL is *fully interoperable* with standard VHDL/Verilog-based EDA tools (simulators and synthetizers) as the output generated by the toolchain could be VHDL or Verilog. <br/><br/>It also enables mixed designs where SpinalHDL components inter-operate with VHDL or Verilog IPs." %}

### Advantages of using SpinalHDL over VHDL / Verilog
As SpinalHDL is based on a high-level language, it provides several advantages to improve your hardware coding:

1. *No more endless wiring* - Create and connect complex buses like AXI in one single line.
1. *Evolving capabilities* - Create your own buses definition and abstraction layer.
1. *Reduce code size* - by a high factor, especially for wiring. This enables you to have a better overview of your code base, increase your productivity and create fewer headaches.
1. *Free and user friendly IDE* - Thanks to scala world for auto-completion, error highlight, navigation shortcut and many others.
1. *Powerful and easy type conversions* - Bidirectional translation between any data type and bits. Useful to load a complex data structure from a CPU interface.
1. *Loop detection* - Tools check for you that there is no combinatorial loop / latch.
1. *Clock domains safety* - The tools inform you that there is no user unintentional cross clock domain.
1. *Generic design* - There are no restrictions to the genericity of your hardware description by using Scala constructs.

### License
SpinalHDL use two licenses, one for the spinal.core, and one for the spinal.lib.

The spinal.core (the compiler) is under the LGPL license, which could be summarized with following statements :

- You can make money with your SpinalHDL description and its generated RTL.
- You don't have to share your SpinalHDL description and its generated RTL.
- There is no fees, no royalties.
- If your make improvements on the SpinalHDL core, please, share your modifications to make the tool better for everybody.

The spinal.lib (a general purpose library of components/tools/interfaces) is under the permissive MIT license.
