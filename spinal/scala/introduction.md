Scala is a very capable programming language that was influenced by a set of language, but often, this set of language doesn't cross the ones that people use. That doesn't help the understanding of concepts and design choice behind Scala.

Followings chapters will present Scala, and try to provide enough information about it to be comfortable with SpinalHDL.
