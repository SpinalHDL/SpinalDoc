## Introduction
This example will take the `UartCtrl` component implemented in the previous [example](/SpinalDoc/spinal/examples/uart/) to create a memory mapped UART controller.

## Specification
The implementation will be based on the APB3 bus with a RX FIFO.

Here is the register mapping table:

| Name | Type | Access | Address | Description |
| ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| clockDivider | UInt | RW | 0 | Set the UartCtrl clock divider |
| frame | UartCtrlFrameConfig | RW  | 4 | Set the dataLength, the parity and the stop bit configuration |
| writeCmd | Bits | W | 8 | Send a write command to UartCtrl |
| writeBusy | Bool | R | 8 | Bit 0 => zero when a new writeCmd can be sent |
| read | Bool / Bits | R | 12 | Bits 7 downto 0 => rx payload <br> Bit 31 => rx payload valid |

## Implementation
For this implementation, the Apb3SlaveFactory tool will be used. It allows you to define a APB3 slave with a nice syntax. You can find the documentation of this tool [there](/SpinalDoc/spinal/lib/bus_slave_factory/).

First, we just need to define the `Apb3Config` that will be used for the controller. It is defined in a Scala object as a function to be able to get it from everywhere.

```scala
object Apb3UartCtrl{
  def getApb3Config = Apb3Config(
    addressWidth = 4,
    dataWidth    = 32
  )
}
```

Then we can define a `Apb3UartCtrl` component which instantiates a `UartCtrl` and creates the memory mapping logic between it and the APB3 bus:

```scala
class Apb3UartCtrl(uartCtrlConfig : UartCtrlGenerics, rxFifoDepth : Int) extends Component{
  val io = new Bundle{
    val bus =  slave(Apb3(Apb3UartCtrl.getApb3Config))
    val uart = master(Uart())
  }

  // Instanciate an simple uart controller
  val uartCtrl = new UartCtrl(uartCtrlConfig)
  io.uart <> uartCtrl.io.uart

  // Create an instance of the Apb3SlaveFactory that will then be used as a slave factory drived by io.bus
  val busCtrl = Apb3SlaveFactory(io.bus)

  // Ask the busCtrl to create a readable/writable register at the address 0
  // and drive uartCtrl.io.config.clockDivider with this register
  busCtrl.driveAndRead(uartCtrl.io.config.clockDivider,address = 0)

  // Do the same thing than above but for uartCtrl.io.config.frame at the address 4
  busCtrl.driveAndRead(uartCtrl.io.config.frame,address = 4)

  // Ask the busCtrl to create a writable Flow[Bits] (valid/payload) at the address 8.
  // Then convert it into a stream and connect it to the uartCtrl.io.write by using an register stage (>->)
  busCtrl.createAndDriveFlow(Bits(uartCtrlConfig.dataWidthMax bits),address = 8).toStream >-> uartCtrl.io.write

  // To avoid losing writes commands between the Flow to Stream transformation just above,
  // make the occupancy of the uartCtrl.io.write readable at address 8
  busCtrl.read(uartCtrl.io.write.valid,address = 8)

  // Take uartCtrl.io.read, convert it into a Stream, then connect it to the input of a FIFO of 64 elements
  // Then make the output of the FIFO readable at the address 12 by using a non blocking protocol
  // (Bit 7 downto 0 => read data <br> Bit 31 => read data valid )
  busCtrl.readStreamNonBlocking(uartCtrl.io.read.toStream.queue(rxFifoDepth),
                                address = 12, validBitOffset = 31, payloadBitOffset = 0)
}
```
