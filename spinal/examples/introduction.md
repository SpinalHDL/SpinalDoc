Examples are split in tree kinds:

- Simples ones, that could be used to get SpinalHDL basics
- Intermediates ones, which implements components by using an traditional approach
- Advanced ones, which go further traditional HDL by using object oriented programming, functional programming and meta-hardware description

They are all accessible in the sidebar under corresponding sections.
