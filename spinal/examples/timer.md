## Introduction
A timer module is probably one of the most basic piece of hardware. But even for that kind of things, there is some interresting things that you can do with SpinalHDL. This example will define a Simple Timer module which integrate a bus bridging utile.

## Timer
So let's start with the Timer component.

### Specification
The Timer module will have a single construction parameter :

| Parameter Name  |  Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| width | Int | Specify the width of the timer counter |

And also some inputs/outputs :

| IO Name  | Direction | Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| tick | in | Bool | When `tick` is True, the timer count up until `limit`. |
| clear | in | Bool | When `tick` is True, the timer is set to zero. `clear` has the priority over `tick`. |
| limit | in |  UInt(width bits) | When the timer value is equals to `limit`, the `tick` input is inhibited. |
| full | out | Bool | full is high when the timer value is equals to `limit`  |
| value | out | UInt(width bits)  | Wire out the timer counter value. |

### Implementation

```scala
case class Timer(width : Int) extends Component{
  val io = new Bundle{
    val tick      = in Bool
    val clear     = in Bool
    val limit     = in UInt(width bits)

    val full  = out Bool
    val value     = out UInt(width bits)
  }

  val counter = Reg(UInt(width bits))
  when(io.tick && !io.full){
    counter := counter + 1
  }
  when(io.clear){
    counter := 0
  }

  io.full := counter === io.limit
  io.value := counter
}
```

## Bridging function
Now we can start with the main purpose of this example => Defining a bus bridging function. To do that we will use two techniques :

- Using the BusSlaveFactory tool documented [there](/SpinalDoc/spinal/lib/bus_slave_factory/)
- Defining a function inside the Timer component which can be called from the parent component to drive Timer's IO by an abstract ways.

### Specification
This bridging function will take followings parameters :

| Parameter Name  |  Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| busCtrl | BusSlaveFactory | The BusSlaveFactory instance that will be used by the function to create the bridging logic |
| baseAddress | BigInt | The base address where the bridging logic should be mapped |
| ticks | Seq[Bool] | A list of Bool sources which can be used as a tick signal |
| clears | Seq[Bool] | A list of Bool sources which can be used as a clear signal|

The register mapping will make the assumption that the bus system is a 32 bits width :

| Name | Access | Width | Address offset | Bit offset |  Description |
| ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| ticksEnable | RW | len(ticks) | 0 | 0 | Each ticks bool can be actived if the corresponding ticksEnable bit is high. |
| clearsEnable | RW | len(clears) | 0 | 16 | Each clears bool can be actived if the corresponding clearsEnable bit is high. |
| limit | RW | width | 4  | 0 | Access the limit value of the timer component.<br> When this register is written, the timer is cleared. |
| value | R | width | 8  | 0 | Access the value of the timer. |
| clear | W | - | 8  | - | When this register is written, it clear the timer. |

### Implementation
Let's add this bridging function inside the Timer component.

```scala
case class Timer(width : Int) extends Component{
  // ....

  // The function prototype use Scala curring funcName(arg1,arg2)(arg3,arg3)
  // which allow to call the function with a smooth syntax later
  // This function also return an area, which allow to keep names of inner signals into the generated VHDL/Verilog.
  def driveFrom(busCtrl : BusSlaveFactory,baseAddress : BigInt)(ticks : Seq[Bool],clears : Seq[Bool]) = new Area {
    //Address 0 => clear/tick masks + bus
    val ticksEnable  = busCtrl.createReadWrite(Bits(ticks.length bits),baseAddress + 0,0) init(0)
    val clearsEnable = busCtrl.createReadWrite(Bits(clears.length bits),baseAddress + 0,16) init(0)
    val busClearing  = False

    io.clear := (clearsEnable & clears.asBits).orR | busClearing
    io.tick  := (ticksEnable  & ticks.asBits ).orR

    //Address 4 => read/write limit (+ auto clear)
    busCtrl.driveAndRead(io.limit,baseAddress + 4)
    busClearing setWhen(busCtrl.isWriting(baseAddress + 4))

    //Address 8 => read timer value / write => clear timer value
    busCtrl.read(io.value,baseAddress + 8)
    busClearing setWhen(busCtrl.isWriting(baseAddress + 8))
  }
}
```

### Usage
There is a demonstration code which is very close to the one used into the Pinsec SoC timer module. Basically it instantiate following elements :

- One 16 bits prescaler
- One 32 bits timer
- Three 16 bits timer

Then by using an Apb3SlaveFactory and functions defined inside the Timers, it create a bridging logic between the APB3 bus and all instantiated components.

```scala
val io = new Bundle{
  val apb = Apb3(ApbConfig(addressWidth = 8, dataWidth = 32))
  val interrupt = in Bool
  val external = new Bundle{
    val tick  = Bool
    val clear = Bool
  }
}

//Prescaler is very similar to the timer, it mainly integrate an auto reload logic.
val prescaler = Prescaler(width = 16)

val timerA = Timer(width = 32)
val timerB,timerC,timerD = Timer(width = 16)

val busCtrl = Apb3SlaveFactory(io.apb)
val prescalerBridge = prescaler.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x00)

val timerABridge = timerA.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x40)(
  // The first element is True, which allow to have a mode where the timer is always counting up.
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow),
  // By looping the timer full to the clears, it allow to create an autoreload mode.
  clears = List(timerA.io.full)           
)

val timerBBridge = timerB.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x50)(
  //The external.tick could allow to create an impulsion counter mode
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),  
  //external.clear could allow to create an timeout mode.
  clears = List(timerB.io.full, io.external.clear)          
)

val timerCBridge = timerC.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x60)(
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),
  clears = List(timerC.io.full, io.external.clear)
)

val timerDBridge = timerD.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x70)(
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),
  clears = List(timerD.io.full, io.external.clear)
)

val interruptCtrl = InterruptCtrl(4)
val interruptCtrlBridge = interruptCtrl.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x10)
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(0) := timerA.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(1) := timerB.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(2) := timerC.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(3) := timerD.io.full
io.interrupt := interruptCtrl.io.pendings.orR
```
