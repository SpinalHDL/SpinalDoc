## Introduction
A timer module is probably one of the most basic pieces of hardware. But even for a timer, there are some interresting things that you can do with SpinalHDL. This example will define a simple timer component which integrates a bus bridging utile.

## Timer
So let's start with the `Timer` component.

### Specification
The `Timer` component will have a single construction parameter:

| Parameter Name  |  Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| width | Int | Specify the bit width of the timer counter |

And also some inputs/outputs:

| IO Name  | Direction | Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| tick | in | Bool | When `tick` is True, the timer count up until `limit`. |
| clear | in | Bool | When `tick` is True, the timer is set to zero. `clear` has priority over `tick`. |
| limit | in |  UInt(width bits) | When the timer value is equal to `limit`, the `tick` input is inhibited. |
| full | out | Bool | `full` is high when the timer value is equal to `limit` and `tick` is high. |
| value | out | UInt(width bits)  | Wire out the timer counter value. |

### Implementation

```scala
case class Timer(width : Int) extends Component{
  val io = new Bundle{
    val tick      = in Bool
    val clear     = in Bool
    val limit     = in UInt(width bits)

    val full  = out Bool
    val value     = out UInt(width bits)
  }

  val counter = Reg(UInt(width bits))
  when(io.tick && !io.full){
    counter := counter + 1
  }
  when(io.clear){
    counter := 0
  }

  io.full := counter === io.limit && io.tick
  io.value := counter
}
```

## Bridging function
Now we can start with the main purpose of this example: defining a bus bridging function. To do that we will use two techniques:

- Using the `BusSlaveFactory` tool documented [here](/SpinalDoc/spinal/lib/bus_slave_factory/)
- Defining a function inside the `Timer` component which can be called from the parent component to drive the `Timer`'s IO in an abstract way.

### Specification
This bridging function will take the following parameters:

| Parameter Name  |  Type  | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| busCtrl | BusSlaveFactory | The `BusSlaveFactory` instance that will be used by the function to create the bridging logic. |
| baseAddress | BigInt | The base address where the bridging logic should be mapped. |
| ticks | Seq[Bool] | A list of Bool sources that can be used as a tick signal. |
| clears | Seq[Bool] | A list of Bool sources that can be used as a clear signal. |

The register mapping assumes that the bus system is 32 bits wide:

| Name | Access | Width | Address offset | Bit offset |  Description |
| ------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| ticksEnable | RW | len(ticks) | 0 | 0 | Each `ticks` bool can be actived if the corresponding `ticksEnable` bit is high. |
| clearsEnable | RW | len(clears) | 0 | 16 | Each `clears` bool can be actived if the corresponding `clearsEnable` bit is high. |
| limit | RW | width | 4  | 0 | Access the limit value of the timer component.<br> When this register is written to, the timer is cleared. |
| value | R | width | 8  | 0 | Access the value of the timer. |
| clear | W | - | 8  | - | When this register is written to, it clears the timer. |

### Implementation
Let's add this bridging function inside the `Timer` component.

```scala
case class Timer(width : Int) extends Component{
  val io = new Bundle{
    val tick      = in Bool
    val clear     = in Bool
    val limit     = in UInt(width bits)

    val full  = out Bool
    val value     = out UInt(width bits)
  }  

  // Logic previously defined
  // ....

  // The function prototype uses Scala currying funcName(arg1,arg2)(arg3,arg3)
  // which allow to call the function with a nice syntax later
  // This function also returns an area, which allows to keep names of inner signals in the generated VHDL/Verilog.
  def driveFrom(busCtrl : BusSlaveFactory,baseAddress : BigInt)(ticks : Seq[Bool],clears : Seq[Bool]) = new Area {
    //Address 0 => clear/tick masks + bus
    val ticksEnable  = busCtrl.createReadWrite(Bits(ticks.length bits),baseAddress + 0,0) init(0)
    val clearsEnable = busCtrl.createReadWrite(Bits(clears.length bits),baseAddress + 0,16) init(0)
    val busClearing  = False

    io.clear := (clearsEnable & clears.asBits).orR | busClearing
    io.tick  := (ticksEnable  & ticks.asBits ).orR

    //Address 4 => read/write limit (+ auto clear)
    busCtrl.driveAndRead(io.limit,baseAddress + 4)
    busClearing setWhen(busCtrl.isWriting(baseAddress + 4))

    //Address 8 => read timer value / write => clear timer value
    busCtrl.read(io.value,baseAddress + 8)
    busClearing setWhen(busCtrl.isWriting(baseAddress + 8))
  }
}
```

### Usage
Here is some demonstration code which is very close to the one used in the Pinsec SoC timer module. Basically it instantiates following elements:

- One 16 bit prescaler
- One 32 bit timer
- Three 16 bit timers

Then by using an `Apb3SlaveFactory` and functions defined inside the `Timer`s, it creates bridging logic between the APB3 bus and all instantiated components.

```scala
val io = new Bundle{
  val apb = Apb3(ApbConfig(addressWidth = 8, dataWidth = 32))
  val interrupt = in Bool
  val external = new Bundle{
    val tick  = Bool
    val clear = Bool
  }
}

//Prescaler is very similar to the timer, it mainly integrates a piece of auto reload logic.
val prescaler = Prescaler(width = 16)

val timerA = Timer(width = 32)
val timerB,timerC,timerD = Timer(width = 16)

val busCtrl = Apb3SlaveFactory(io.apb)
val prescalerBridge = prescaler.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x00)

val timerABridge = timerA.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x40)(
  // The first element is True, which allows you to have a mode where the timer is always counting up.
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow),
  // By looping the timer full to the clears, it allows you to create an autoreload mode.
  clears = List(timerA.io.full)
)

val timerBBridge = timerB.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x50)(
  //The external.tick could allow to create an impulsion counter mode
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),
  //external.clear could allow to create an timeout mode.
  clears = List(timerB.io.full, io.external.clear)
)

val timerCBridge = timerC.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x60)(
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),
  clears = List(timerC.io.full, io.external.clear)
)

val timerDBridge = timerD.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x70)(
  ticks  = List(True, prescaler.io.overflow, io.external.tick),
  clears = List(timerD.io.full, io.external.clear)
)

val interruptCtrl = InterruptCtrl(4)
val interruptCtrlBridge = interruptCtrl.driveFrom(busCtrl,0x10)
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(0) := timerA.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(1) := timerB.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(2) := timerC.io.full
interruptCtrl.io.inputs(3) := timerD.io.full
io.interrupt := interruptCtrl.io.pendings.orR
```
