# SpinalDoc writing guidelines

These rules when followed aim at getting a more coherent set of documents.

## Use one page per topic/item
- do not document anything else on that page.
- The first thing of the page should be a description of the topic so he knows what we
are talking about.

## Divide the subject/page into subtopics
- Each block of paragraphs should have a title.
- Keep subtopics logically separated. 
- Think : what does the user want to know about this topic ?

###Example: Component Hierarchy
What user want to know about component hierarchy:
- How to create a component
- How to instanciate a component
- How to access signals hierarchy

## Keep examples as small and to the point as possible(max 15 lines)
- Do not add application examples within doc, most of the times, the user 
does not want to dissecate code to understand how to use something.
- Documented examples should go to the Examples section where size limit does not apply
